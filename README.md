# HACKUCI_challenge
Includes the website I created for the HACKUCI challenge

A simple website displaying images from GettyImages.

# What works
* Lightbox
* Next and Prev buttons
* Images from GettyImage API

# Notes
* The initial search is "space"
* Has no bootstrap, so it might not look neat on smaller screens
* The images provided by GettyImages are low resolution
* I tried to add input forms but didn't have any more time I could dedicate
